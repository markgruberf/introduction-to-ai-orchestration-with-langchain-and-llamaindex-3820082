President and Managing Director, North America\n\nHarold Wandalere, EVP and General Counsel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Story Behind THE Landon Hotel \n\nThe values that Mr. Landon held so dear to his heart, were evidently values that appealed to travelers the world over. The Landon advertised luxurious modern comforts and conveniences, backed by warm, sincere customer service, where guests were treated as friends. Mr. Landon, himself, liked to say \u201cWe\u2019re upscale, not uppity - and refined, not pretentious.\u201d But, most importantly, The Landon philosophy all came down to mirroring the individuality of each neighborhood within the walls of the hotel. With so many hotels within in his realm, Mr. Landon was adamant that none of the hotels should look alike, but instead that they must each take on the personality of their individual locations. He remained ardently true to his original vision until the day he died in August 1998. \n\nStill, at its core, Landon Hotel remains a community based, focusing on the specific needs of individuals and organizations in each community in which its hotels are located. \n\nThank you for your interest in Landon Hotel. We hope you enjoy our products and invite you to send us your comments and suggestions by email to feedback@landonhotel.com.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDahlia Landon & the Entire Landon Hotel family \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\tThe Story Behind THE Landon Hotel\t2\n\n\tSECTION 1: INTRODUCTION\t5\n\n\t1.1 CHANGES IN POLICY\t5\n\n\t1.2 EMPLOYMENT APPLICATIONS\t5\n\n\t1.3 EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP\t5\n\n\tSECTION 2: DEFINITIONS OF EMPLOYEES STATUS\t5\n\n\t2.1 \u201cEMPLOYEES\u201d DEFINED\t5\n\n\t2.2 EXEMPT\t6\n\n\t2.3 NON-EXEMPT\t6\n\n\t2.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1784, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0147d28f-2051-4a10-b81b-323428fcea12": {"__data__": {"id_": "0147d28f-2051-4a10-b81b-323428fcea12", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Landon Hotel employee manual in Word_LIL_34022.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Markgruber Ferenc\\Documents\\GitHub\\introduction-to-ai-orchestration-with-langchain-and-llamaindex-3820082\\Chap02\\handbook\\Landon Hotel employee manual in Word_LIL_34022.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 246345, "creation_date": "2025-02-17", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "709fd19b-0182-4aae-82e4-ced3f5d179f9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "Landon Hotel employee manual in Word_LIL_34022.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Markgruber Ferenc\\Documents\\GitHub\\introduction-to-ai-orchestration-with-langchain-and-llamaindex-3820082\\Chap02\\handbook\\Landon Hotel employee manual in Word_LIL_34022.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 246345, "creation_date": "2025-02-17", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-17"}, "hash": "1bacbfc92d50cc6d87900e083b02962fb8e68bd21a9d7de586c5cac3c81e90f1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f3415730-83d0-428e-bff3-f72a7e779bca", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "Landon Hotel employee manual in Word_LIL_34022.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Markgruber Ferenc\\Documents\\GitHub\\introduction-to-ai-orchestration-with-langchain-and-llamaindex-3820082\\Chap02\\handbook\\Landon Hotel employee manual in Word_LIL_34022.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 246345, "creation_date": "2025-02-17", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-17"}, "hash": "e8f62d687676c6bcf13307f8eb8a612067afe39882c5943c99b0451f8b6095e1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "be6d29f0-b7d7-4b6e-8ab5-07de6e2c0af2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "400ae2f89a81ae54c4c78eb5f32633039b6fdea4b7b043f9662482f0dc89e0e0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "1 \u201cEMPLOYEES\u201d DEFINED\t5\n\n\t2.2 EXEMPT\t6\n\n\t2.3 NON-EXEMPT\t6\n\n\t2.4 REGULAR FULL-TIME\t6\n\n\t2.5 REGULAR PART-TIME\t6\n\n\t2.6 TEMPORARY (FULL-TIME or PART-TIME)\t6\n\n\t2.7 PROBATIONARY PERIOD FOR NEW EMPLOYEES\t6\n\n\tSECTION 3: EMPLOYMENT POLICIES\t6\n\n\t3.1 anti-harrassment and NON-DISCRIMINATION\t6\n\n\t3.2 NON-DISCLOSURE/CONFIDENTIALITY\t7\n\n\t3.3 NEW EMPLOYEE ORIENTATION\t7\n\n\t3.4 PROBATIONARY PERIOD FOR NEW EMPLOYEES\t8\n\n\t3.5 OFFICE HOURS\t8\n\n\t3.6 LUNCH PERIODS\t8\n\n\t3.7 BREAK PERIODS\t8\n\n\t3.8 PERSONNEL FILES\t8\n\n\t3.9 PERSONNEL DATA CHANGES\t9\n\n\t3.10 INCLEMENT WEATHER/EMERGENCY CLOSINGS\t9\n\n\t3.11 EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE REVIEW AND PLANNING SESSIONS\t9\n\n\t3.12 OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT\t10\n\n\t3.13 CORRECTIVE ACTION\t10\n\n\t3.14 EMPLOYMENT TERMINATION\t10\n\n\t3.15 SAFETY\t11\n\n\t3.16 HEALTH-RELATED ISSUES\t11\n\n\t3.17 EMPLOYEE REQUIRING MEDICAL ATTENTION\t12\n\n\t3.18 BUILDING SECURITY\t12\n\n\t3.19 INSURANCE ON PERSONAL EFFECTS\t12\n\n\t3.20 SUPPLIES;

In deciding which initial corrective action would be appropriate, a supervisor will consider the seriousness of the infraction, the circumstances surrounding the matter, and the employee\u2019s previous record.\n\nThough committed to a progressive approach to corrective action, Landon Hotel considers certain rule infractions and violations of standards as grounds for immediate termination of employment.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 15926, "end_char_idx": 18113, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e6ac226c-ed84-4b53-9353-313d8f1710f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "e6ac226c-ed84-4b53-9353-313d8f1710f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Landon Hotel employee manual in Word_LIL_34022.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Markgruber Ferenc\\Documents\\GitHub\\introduction-to-ai-orchestration-with-langchain-and-llamaindex-3820082\\Chap02\\handbook\\Landon Hotel employee manual in Word_LIL_34022.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 246345, "creation_date": "2025-02-17", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "709fd19b-0182-4aae-82e4-ced3f5d179f9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "Landon Hotel employee manual in Word_LIL_34022.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Markgruber Ferenc\\Documents\\GitHub\\introduction-to-ai-orchestration-with-langchain-and-llamaindex-3820082\\Chap02\\handbook\\Landon Hotel employee manual in Word_LIL_34022.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 246345, "creation_date": "2025-02-17", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-17"}, "hash": "1bacbfc92d50cc6d87900e083b02962fb8e68bd21a9d7de586c5cac3c81e90f1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bb70f03d-cd1c-4e77-9ce7-38d896c9b865", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "Landon Hotel employee manual in Word_LIL_34022.docx", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\Markgruber Ferenc\\Documents\\GitHub\\introduction-to-ai-orchestration-with-langchain-and-llamaindex-3820082\\Chap02\\handbook\\Landon Hotel employee manual in Word_LIL_34022.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 246345, "creation_date": "2025-02-17", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-17"}, "hash": "04a68284ffeaf50b3c74ed5b81abc733460be7a6b93a90c7cf05a08aa66ad6d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6ae59e1f-3f73-4bfe-99fb-ce5d499e2978", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "929e138ef2c0c3f2d8a5fed3d74abc36e2ee77d19b6bb04f5de45b15486078ab", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Though committed to a progressive approach to corrective action, Landon Hotel considers certain rule infractions and violations of standards as grounds for immediate termination of employment.
